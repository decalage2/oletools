crypto.py

Module to be used by other scripts and modules in oletools, that provides
information on encryption in OLE files.

Uses :py:mod:`msoffcrypto-tool` to decrypt if it is available. Otherwise
decryption will fail with an ImportError.

Encryption/Write-Protection can be realized in many different ways. They range
from setting a single flag in an otherwise unprotected file to embedding a
regular file (e.g.  xlsx) in an EncryptedStream inside an OLE file. That means
that (1) that lots of bad things are accesible even if no encryption password
is known, and (2) even basic attributes like the file type can change by
decryption. Therefore I suggest the following general routine to deal with
potentially encrypted files::

    def script_main_function(input_file, passwords, crypto_nesting=0, args):
        '''Wrapper around main function to deal with encrypted files.'''
        initial_stuff(input_file, args)
        result = None
        try:
            result = do_your_thing_assuming_no_encryption(input_file)
            if not crypto.is_encrypted(input_file):
                return result
        except Exception:
            if not crypto.is_encrypted(input_file):
                raise
        # we reach this point only if file is encrypted
        # check if this is an encrypted file in an encrypted file in an ...
        if crypto_nesting >= crypto.MAX_NESTING_DEPTH:
            raise crypto.MaxCryptoNestingReached(crypto_nesting, filename)
        decrypted_file = None
        try:
            decrypted_file = crypto.decrypt(input_file, passwords)
            if decrypted_file is None:
                raise crypto.WrongEncryptionPassword(input_file)
            # might still be encrypted, so call this again recursively
            result = script_main_function(decrypted_file, passwords,
                                          crypto_nesting+1, args)
        except Exception:
            raise
        finally:     # clean up
            try:     # (maybe file was not yet created)
                os.unlink(decrypted_file)
            except Exception:
                pass

(Realized e.g. in :py:mod:`oletools.msodde`).
That means that caller code needs another wrapper around its main function. I
did try it another way first (a transparent on-demand unencrypt) but for the
above reasons I believe this is the better way. Also, non-top-level-code can
just assume that it works on unencrypted data and fail with an exception if
encrypted data makes its work impossible. No need to check `if is_encrypted()`
at the start of functions.
