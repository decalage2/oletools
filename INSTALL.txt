How to Download and Install oletools
====================================

Pre-requisites
--------------

The recommended Python version to run oletools is the latest **Python 3.x** (3.7 for now).
Python 2.7 is still supported, but as it will become end of life in 2020 (see https://pythonclock.org/), it is highly
recommended to switch to Python 3 now.

Recommended way to Download+Install/Update oletools: pip
--------------------------------------------------------

Pip is included with Python since version 2.7.9 and 3.4. If it is not installed on your
system, either upgrade Python or see https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

### Linux, Mac OSX, Unix

To download and install/update the latest release version of oletools,
run the following command in a shell:

```text
sudo -H pip install -U oletools
```

Replace `pip` by `pip3` or `pip2` to install on a specific Python version.

**Important**: Since version 0.50, pip will automatically create convenient command-line scripts
in /usr/local/bin to run all the oletools from any directory.

### Windows

To download and install/update the latest release version of oletools,
run the following command in a cmd window:

```text
pip install -U oletools
```

Replace `pip` by `pip3` or `pip2` to install on a specific Python version.

**Note**: with Python 3, you may need to open a cmd window with Administrator privileges in order to run pip
and install for all users. If that is not possible, you may also install only for the current user
by adding the `--user` option:

```text
pip3 install -U --user oletools
```

**Important**: Since version 0.50, pip will automatically create convenient command-line scripts
to run all the oletools from any directory: olevba, mraptor, oleid, rtfobj, etc.


How to install the latest development version
---------------------------------------------

If you want to benefit from the latest improvements in the development version,
you may also use pip:

### Linux, Mac OSX, Unix

```text
sudo -H pip install -U https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/archive/master.zip
```

Replace `pip` by `pip3` or `pip2` to install on a specific Python version.

### Windows

```text
pip install -U https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/archive/master.zip
```

Replace `pip` by `pip3` or `pip2` to install on a specific Python version.

**Note**: with Python 3, you may need to open a cmd window with Administrator privileges in order to run pip
and install for all users. If that is not possible, you may also install only for the current user
by adding the `--user` option:

```text
pip3 install -U --user https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/archive/master.zip
```

How to install offline - Computer without Internet access
---------------------------------------------------------

First, download the oletools archive on a computer with Internet access:
* Latest stable version: from https://pypi.org/project/oletools/ or https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/releases
* Development version: https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/archive/master.zip

Copy the archive file to the target computer.

On Linux, Mac OSX, Unix, run the following command using the filename of the
archive that you downloaded:

```text
sudo -H pip install -U oletools.zip
```

On Windows:

```text
pip install -U oletools.zip
```


Old school install using setup.py
---------------------------------

If you cannot use pip, it is still possible to run the setup.py script
directly. However, this method will not create the command-line scripts
automatically.

First, download the oletools archive:
* Latest stable version: from https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/releases
* Development version: https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/archive/master.zip

Then extract the archive, open a shell and go to the oletools directory.

### Linux, Mac OSX, Unix

```text
sudo -H python setup.py install
```

### Windows:

```text
python setup.py install
```
